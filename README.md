# Housing Price Prediction Using Machine Learning 

 
 

Library Used:    Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Sklearn 

 
Overview:  

Housing Price Prediction is a lucrative use case for Real Estates. The algorithm is based on 'Boston Housing Data' from the 'UCI' Machine Learning repository. 

In this project, We had cleaned, Analysed, and Scaled the data. 

We had evaluated three algorithms namely, 
1. Linear Regression 
2. Decision Trees 
3. Random Forest 

Random Forest Regressor had the least rmse(root mean square error). We further fine-tuned the model using Randomized Search CV, and after the final evaluation on a test set, we dumped the model using the joblib package.
